#Hello I go by the name humunchi (rhymes whith bumcheeks) on the internet. I started learning how to code in high school because I like computers. I got my first pc at 7 I played games on it mainly. last year I bought myself this laptop to continue learnign how to code. I have so many passions that I find it difficult to just be one thing so I've stopped trying to be just one thing. I love drawing, performance art, playing guitar, singing, writing, coding, making films, cycling, yoga, water, fruits, vegies, sleep, music, reading and studying learning new things. I know very little about how to use Git Hub at the moment. 20 Aug 20
